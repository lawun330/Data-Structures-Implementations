# Data-Structures-Implementations
I learned how to implement specific data structures at the University of the People. Files within this repository are assignments that reflect my DSA learning journey. You can use any IDE for a file unless there is an explicit mention to run in the Jeliot 3 environment. I advise you to read comments.

So far, I have implemented
- List
- Stack
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree (self-balanced BST)
- General Tree
- Insertion sort
- Mergesort
- Shellsort
- Quicksort
